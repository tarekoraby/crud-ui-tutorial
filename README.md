# A CRUD UI in Pure Java

This project implements a web UI that performs full CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations on a Spring Data JPA backend. And you did it in pure Java â€“ without the need for any HTML or JavaScript, and without having to expose REST services or think about HTTP requests, responses, and filter chains.

The project is a standard Maven project. To run it from the command line,
type `mvnw` (Windows), or `./mvnw` (Mac & Linux), then open
http://localhost:8080/register in your browser.

You can also import the project to your IDE of choice as you would with any
Maven project. Read more on [how to set up a development environment for
Vaadin projects](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/guide/install) (Windows, Linux, macOS).
